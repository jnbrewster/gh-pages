I've finally bought a domain name and linked it to github pages!
This site for now is running [Jekyl](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [poole](http://getpoole.com/) with the [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) theme.

# General Assembly
Well, In 18 days I will be down in Melbourne and will study at a **Web Development Immersive** at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/) until the end of July.
I am very excited to be doing something like this as I've been studying by myself and working in a different profession for so long. It will be amazing to meet and work with other people who share the same enthusiasm and passion as me.

I hope to update posts every week or so with things I've learnt along the way and interesting ideas to look back on later.

## 4 Week Overview
*Here are some general headings that I'll flesh out in later posts as I go along week to week.*
