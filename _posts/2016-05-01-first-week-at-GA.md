Wow. What a week!

I've been in Melbourne for about 10 days now. The last week has been super busy and difficult but a lot of fun. I've really enjoyed meeting all the different students here and there and the teachers. I've really liked all the code challenges and the new concepts we've gone over. We've been blazing throught javascript; going over arrays, functions, loops and objects. I've learnt so much this week. I wonder how much content we'll cover when the course comes closer to completion.

I regret not doing something like GA sooner than I have. It's been really evident how much content we've gone through in such a short time. I'm quite tired but hope to keep pushing along.

I also hope to put up some materials/reviews/notes of the things I've done so far. I need to clean up all the things we've done up to now and get them on [github](https://github.com/joelbrewster)!
