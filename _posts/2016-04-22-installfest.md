title: InstallFest Orientation
---
I'm in Melbourne now! It's such an interesting place.
I spent the day figuring out the trams and trying to find an easy way to go to General Assembly from where I'm staying (Awesome friends' house).
At General Assembly we had a few beers and some pizza. It was a very relaxed vibe. Everyone was super friendly too.

The InstallFest was us meeting our teachers and installing the same versions of RVM and NVM.
I look forward to getting to know everyone there better.
