## About me

My name is Joel. I am a 32 year old dad that has been teaching since 2008, and have decided to persue my dream of being a developer.
I love to study, learn and practice coding every day. I love computers, mechanical keyboards, tmux, vim and ncurses interfaces.
I am having a lot of fun reading books on javascript right now.

Thanks!
