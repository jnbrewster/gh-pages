					My name is Joel. I'm a 32 year old dad that has been teaching ESL since 2008, and have decided to change careers into IT.
					</p>

					<p>
					I love to learn, study and practice coding every day. I love computers, mechanical keyboards, tmux, vim and ncurses interfaces.
					</p>

					<p>
					I'm having fun with Rails and Ruby at the moment.
