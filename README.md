#Landing page
##Initial layout and ideas
I started work on my first landing page. I made a horizontal layout on [mockingbird](https://gomockingbird.com).

On a larger display there were 3 static sections up the top with the headings; about, projects and contact information.
It had a page under each heading with corresponding information.

|about|projects|contact
---

I had trouble with getting a table to move smoothly from horizontal layout to a vertical layout on a smaller screen. I changed the group of headings from a list to a table and added media queries to change from a phone to
a tablet or a bigger screen. I felt like having it change from a horizontal layout to a vertical one was just an exercise and didn't really improve the look of the page.

After simplifying the idea of the site, I changed the landing page to a vertical layout. I had some problems with border, padding and margin sizes with safari, google chrome and firefox behaving in the same way.
The layout worked perfectly in safari but had excessive space up the top of the headings with firefox. When I get access to a windows computer I'll see how it looks using Internet Explorer. I hope the spacing looks right.

#Layout 2
I ended up removing all the page information as it was mostly information about my
github projects. I'm going to change the links to projects to a pop-up that shows an
image and some basic information to checkout on gitgub.

##Colors
I'm still unsure what sort of color theme I'd like to use on the landing page. Initially I was using colors that are around my house, colors that are based off [Seoul colors](http://www.seoul.go.kr/v2012/seoul/symbol/color.html).

#Layout 3
Added a modalDialog to show completed projects. Added git hub links.
