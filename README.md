#Landing page
##Initial layout and ideas
I started work on my first landing page. I made a horizontal layout on [mockingbird](https://gomockingbird.com).

On a larger display there were 3 static sections up the top with the headings; about, projects and contact information.
It had a page under each heading with corresponding information.

|about|projects|contact
---

I had trouble with getting a table to move smoothly from horizontal layout to a vertical layout on a smaller screen. I changed the group of headings from a list to a table and added media queries to change from a phone to
a tablet or a bigger screen. I felt like having it change from a horizontal layout to a vertical one was just an exercise and didn't really improve the look of the page.

After simplifying the idea of the site, I changed the landing page to a vertical layout. I had some problems with border, padding and margin sizes with safari, google chrome and firefox behaving in the same way.
The layout worked perfectly in safari but had excessive space up the top of the headings with firefox. When I get access to a windows computer I'll see how it looks using Internet Explorer. I hope the spacing looks right.

##Second version - vertical layout
I ended up removing all the page information as it was mostly information about my github projects. Going to the github link would have the same information anyway.
